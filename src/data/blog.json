Then they seem less monstrous themselves.When they get blind-drunk, cheat, steal, beat their wives, starve an old woman, when they kill a trapped fox with an axe or riddle the last existing unicorn with arrows, they like to thinkthat the Bane entering cottagesat daybreak is more monstrous than they are. They feel better then. They find it easier to live. The worst monsters are the one we create."

Do not dilute the truth of your potential. We often convince that we cannot change, that we can't overcome the circumstances of our lives. That is simply not true. You have been blessed with immeasurable power to make positive changes in your life. But you can't just Wish it, you can't just Hope it, you can't just Want it... You have to Live it, Be it, Do it."

Each one is shaped to represent the school a witcher comes from.The witcher medallion is not only an insignia of witcher's profession, it is also one of its tools. It has numerous useful capabilities that are accessible, of course, only to one who possesses the necessary knowledge and training. First of all, it reacts to the presence of sorcerous auras in the immediate surroundings, making us aware of nearby spellcasting, active illusions, or magical creatures. It also warns the owner of sudden dangers, thus providing an additional moment to react. Keep in mind, though, that the medallion is not infallible. A very strong magical aura, such as those found in Places of Power or during the solstices, can provoke aberrant reactions. In large cities, where people widely use simple magical amulets or sorcerous alarm systems to protect their homes, coin, or ruttish wives, the medallion can also behave abnormally. "
